A prop is an **inanimate** object. Things like tables, chairs, and buildings fall under this category. A tree on the other hand would be a character *if it is animated*. 

- If a door is animated, it belongs under the character category

- **The naming convention** for props is **prop_propName_version**
	- Examples:
	 - prop_door_dark
	 - prop_door_maple
	 - prop_door_cherry
