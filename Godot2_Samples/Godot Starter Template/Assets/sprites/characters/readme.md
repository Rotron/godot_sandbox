A character is an **animated** object.

- Average body height is **8 heads** for a human(oid) character in this style.
Since the head is 3 pixels high, not including the hair, 24 pixels is the *ideal* height of characters.

- **Character animations** should be no more than **8 frames**. Maintain the correct **proportions**. Use **layers**. The head (face, ear, neck), hair, torso, hip, upper leg, and lower leg (shin,feet) should *ideally* be on their own layers to allow more **flexibility** for edits.

- **The naming convention** for characters is **chr_chrName_version**
	- Examples:
		- chr_male_pale
		- chr_male_fair
		- chr_male_dark

The **characters** were created *roughly* in this order:

1. Face
2. Neck
3. Ear
4. Face highlight
5. Neck shadow
6. Shoulders
7. Torso
8. Hip
9. Legs
10. Torso highlight
11. Torso shadow
12. Arms
13. Hair

Here are the pixel height stats for the base character

- 3 block(s) - face
- 1 blocks(s) - neck
- 5 blocks(s) - torso
- 2 blocks(s) - hip
- 6 blocks(s) - thigh
- 7 blocks(s) - shin
